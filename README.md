### What is this?

Simple, its a tool set for PHP. Currently comprised of two core components shell and browser.

This project strives to give developers the tools that let them automate processes that were designed for people.

My philosophy: 

<b>People should only do interesting work. If it can be automated it should be automated.</b>
